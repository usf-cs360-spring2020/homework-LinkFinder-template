LinkFinder
=================================================

![Points](../../blob/badges/points.svg)

For this homework, you will get all of the URLs from well-formed hyperlinks (or just **links**) from a snippet of HTML. Specifically, your code must return a list of HTTP or HTTPS URLs (or links) from the HTML `a` anchor tag `href` attribute. This should not include URLs in the `href` attribute of the `link` tag!

A method is provided that will make sure URLs are in a semi-consistent properly-encoded form. Your code must figure out how to deal with relative vs absolute URLs, however. See below for more.

## Hints ##

There are many helpful resources on the web to learn more about HTML. Some resources include:

* [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
* [W3C Markup Validation](https://validator.w3.org/)
* [Web Design Group](https://htmlhelp.com/)
* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web)

#### Anchor Tags

You will need to be familiar with the HTML anchor tag `<a>` and `URL` protocol for this assignment. Some resources include:

* [MDN - &lt;a&gt; The Anchor element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a)
* [MDN - What is a URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL)
* [The Java Tutorials - Creating a URL](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/networking/urls/creatingUrls.html)

The anchor tag is used to create links on web pages. For example:

```html
<a href="https://www.cs.usfca.edu/">USF CS</a>
```

The above code will generate the link <a href="https://www.cs.usfca.edu/">USF CS</a>, where the link text is `USF CS` and the link destination is the URL `https://www.cs.usfca.edu/`. The link will always be placed in the `href` attribute of the `a` tag, but not all `a` tags will have this attribute. For example, this is a valid `a` tag without the `href` attribute:

```html
<a name="home" class="bookmark">Home</a>
```

And, the `href` attribute may appear in other tags. For example, this is a valid `link` tag to include a style sheet:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
```

Since the `href` attribute above does not appear in an anchor `<a>` tag, it should NOT be parsed by your code.

#### Relative and Absolute Links

Many URLs on webpages are relative (i.e. specified relative to the current webpage URL). Your code will need to convert those relative URLs into an absolute URL. For this, your code may use the `java.net.URL` class. For example, consider the following:

```java
URL base = new URL("http://www.cs.usfca.edu/~sjengle/cs212/");
URL absolute = new URL(base, "../index.html");

// outputs http://www.cs.usfca.edu/~sjengle/index.html
System.out.println(absolute);
```

This works even if the provided string was already absolute. For example:

```java
URL base = new URL("http://www.cs.usfca.edu/~sjengle/cs212/");
URL absolute = new URL(base, "http://www.example.com/");

// outputs http://www.example.com/
System.out.println(absolute);
```

Because of this, you do not need to test if a link was relative or absolute. Your code can **always use the above** approach to process links.

## Instructions ##

Use the "Tasks" view in Eclipse to find the `TODO` comments for what need to be implemented and the "Javadoc" view to see additional details.

The tests are provided in the `src/test/` directory; do not modify any of the files in that directory. Check the run details on GitHub Actions for how many points each test group is worth. 

See the [Homework Guides](https://usf-cs272-spring2023.github.io/resources/homework/) for additional details on homework requirements and submission.
